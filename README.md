# loan-approval-mlflow-api
Loan Approval MLflow API predicts loan approvals using the Loan Approval Dataset. It trains three models — XGBoost, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression — then selects the best one via MLflow. The chosen model is deployed using FastAPI, providing a lightweight, production-ready API for real-time financial predictions.
